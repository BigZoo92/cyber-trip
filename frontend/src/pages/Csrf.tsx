					Welcome to the dark side of NavCom, the hub where the most cunning of

					<span>Villain's</span> Role
				</h2>
				<p>
					As a Master of Deception in the cosmic game of chess, you have the
					ability to orchestrate grand diversions. By luring space voyagers with
					alluring offers and rewards, you cleverly manipulate their route
					submissions, bending the space routes to your will. Beware, though,
					for each action may have unforeseen consequences in the vast expanse
					of space.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your latest scheme involves a cleverly crafted fake rewards page,
					enticing voyagers to unwittingly redirect their course to a hidden
					asteroid field, ripe for plundering. Can you outsmart the galaxy's
					best navigators and claim your prize?

					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
						CSRF tricks a victim into submitting a malicious request. It occurs
						when a malicious web site, email, blog, or program causes a userâ€™s
						web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site for
						which the user is currently authenticated.
					</p>
					<h3>
						<span>Insecure</span>Version
					</h3>
					<p>
						In my ChangeRouteForm.tsx and corresponding change_route.php, if
						state-changing requests are made without proper anti-CSRF tokens, it
						can be exploited.
					</p>
					<CodeBlock code={code2} language="PHP"></CodeBlock>
					<h4>
						<span>Secure</span>Version
					</h4>
					<p>
						Implement anti-CSRF tokens in your forms. Each form should include a
						hidden token that is validated on the server-side.
					</p>
					<CodeBlock code={code1} language="PHP"></CodeBlock>
					<p>In your React form, include the token in a hidden field.</p>
